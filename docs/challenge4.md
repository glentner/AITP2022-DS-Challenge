### Challenge 4
My plan was to graph the temperatures for the first 5 months of the year every single year for every dataset to see what the anomaly present March 2022 was.

#### What actually happened
Due to time restrictions, the most I could graph was the average temp of the data after 2020 in order to see multiple waxes and wanes in the graph and see the anomaly

The anomoly is most likely the sudden uptick in March when it should be going down as summer ends in Antarctica
